This is Task 08 of the Eudyptula Challenge
------------------------------------------

We will come back to the linux-next kernel in a later exercise, so don't
go and delete that directory, you'll want it around.  But enough of
building kernels, let's write more code!

This task is much like the 06 task with the misc device, but this time
we are going to focus on another user/kernel interface, debugfs.  It is
rumored that the creator of debugfs said that there is only one rule for
debugfs use": "There are no rules when using debugfs."  So let's take
them up on that offer and see how to use it.

debugfs should be mounted by your distro in /sys/kernel/debug/.  If it
isn't, then you can mount it with the line:
        mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug/

Make sure it is enabled in your kernel, with the CONFIG_DEBUG_FS option,
you will need it for this task.

The tasks, in specifics are:

  - Take the kernel module you wrote for task 01, and modify it to
    create a debugfs subdirectory called "eudyptula".  In that
    directory, create the virtual file called "id".
  - This "id" file, operates just like it did for example 06, and uses
    the same logic there, the file is to be readable and writable by any
    user.
  - Submit this task as the first email.
  - Base your work on this submission, and create a new debugfs file
    called "jiffies".
  - This "jiffies" file is to be read-only by any user, and when read,
    should return the current value of the jiffies kernel timer.
  - Submit this result as a patch against the first email.
  - Base your work again on that submission, and create a final debugfs
    file called "foo".
  - The file "foo" needs to be writable only by root, but readable by
    anyone.  When writing to it, the value must be stored, up to one
    page of data.  When read, which can be done by any user, the value
    that is stored in it must be returned.  Properly handle the fact
    that someone could be reading from the file while someone else is
    writing to it (oh, a locking hint!)
  - Submit this result as a patch against the second email.
  - When the module is unloaded, all of the debugfs files are cleaned
    up, and any memory allocated is freed, for all submissions.
  - Provide some "proof" this all works in the first email.

Again, you are using your id in the code, so you know what it is by now,
no need to repeat it again.

So, for this task, I expect to see 3 emails, all "linked" somehow, in my
mailbox.  They should look something like this:

        [5d658d788cc9] Task 08 results
        ├─>[5d658d788cc9] [PATCH 01/02] Task 08: add jiffies file
        └─>[5d658d788cc9] [PATCH 02/02] Task 08: add foo file

Or, even better:
        [5d658d788cc9] Task 08 results
        └─>[5d658d788cc9] [PATCH 01/02] Task 08: add jiffies file
          └─>[5d658d788cc9] [PATCH 02/02] Task 08: add foo file

Hint, look at using 'git send-email' as a way to send these files out.
